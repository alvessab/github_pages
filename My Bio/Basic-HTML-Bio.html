  <h3>A short biography:</h3>
  <p>
    Hello, and welcome to my biography page! My name is Sabrina and I am a graduate of Deerfield Academy (Class of 2017) and the University of Dallas (Class of 2020). I received a Bachelor's of Arts in Business from my college and was made a Beta Gamma Sigma member. I am now an employee with Workforce Interactive, where I help the CEO and Founder with a variety of tasks such as training presentatins, Research and Development of new products, analysis of client data, and various administrative tasks. I have signed up for SMU's Data Science Bootcamp to increase my knowledge of computers and to start building my specialty.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope to remain in the HR world and transition into HRIS eventually. I'm not sure if I would like to manage HR data for a large company or if I would like to go into a more academic role in analyzing academic trends 
  </p>
